Hello if you are looking for Arda KAPTAN thats me welcome to my github ... 
most of my projects are private rightnow so if you want to see them I will share them with you.

You may ask if youre willing to share why do you keep them private ... First of all I'm kinda shy about sharing things second I think again it will be shy .. 

So curently there is a wm project(mvc5) that I wrote for my company .. 
more than 5 (currently there is 5 but I won't refresh this index so often so by the time it will be more than 5 )game projects . Current ones are just prototyps and training when I come up with a complete game I will mention it here :D:D
